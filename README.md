- I have created this app using React Native, Redux, React Navigation.
- I created Home screen and Addtask screen.
- All todo task added in redux store and we can edit and delete any todo task.
- Right now i checked only android side, so please check in Android setup only.
- Simply clone the git and `npm install` and then run in android emulator using `npx react-native run-android`.
